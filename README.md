# Employee Performance Prediction (Resigned or Not)

## Overview

This project aims to predict whether an employee will resign based on a range of features, including demographics, job title, department, work experience, education, performance scores, and other factors. The dataset includes employee-specific data and the target variable "Resigned," which indicates whether an employee has resigned or not. By applying machine learning techniques, the goal is to develop a predictive model that helps identify patterns in employee behavior and performance, potentially assisting in HR decision-making and retention strategies.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze trends and patterns in the data.
3. **Model Training**: Train models using classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest).
4. **Evaluation**: Use metrics such as ROC-AUC, precision-recall, and confusion matrix to assess the performance of the model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
